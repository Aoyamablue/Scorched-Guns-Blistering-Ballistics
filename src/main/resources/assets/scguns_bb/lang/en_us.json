  "item.scguns_bb.copper_craftingtool.tooltip": "The necessary tools and materials are listed so that firearms can be produced even in an environment where all normal production activities have ceased.",
  "item.scguns_bb.iron_craftingtool.tooltip": "The thick contract for transferring the production rights of the Firearms, densely filled with text, reveals several unfavorable clauses.",
  "item.scguns_bb.diamond_craftingtool.tooltip": "A somewhat damaged encryption device containing Asgharians' technological capabilities. ",
  "item.scguns_bb.nether_craftingtool.tooltip": "A deck of cards filled with aces of spades, inscribed with the blood-stained experiences of frontline soldiers.",
  "item.scguns_bb.ocean_craftingtool.tooltip": "The old-looking blueprint inside the bottle—but who threw it into the sea?",

"scguns.desc.ambassador": "Designed for VIP protection and urban combat. Its compact size and precision firing are its strengths, but the Asgharians adopted a different submachine gun.",
"scguns.desc.big_betsy": "How about loading multiple rounds? On the front lines, they're heavy, reloading is cumbersome, and they jam easily—but commanders say it doesn't matter.",
"scguns.desc.big_pipe": "‘Replica’ of equipment that was used to great acclaim in the previous war. The fact that they're resorting to using something like this in this situation speaks to the grim reality.",
"scguns.desc.cave_cleaner": "Used to fire a single shot to suppress enemies before entering a cave, but it was actually developed to counter COG equipment.",
"scguns.desc.coral_hunter": "Improved version based on a hunting rifle, sufficiently robust to withstand the harsh marine environment.",
"scguns.desc.door_knocker": "Grenade launcher that looks like it was made a century ago. It embodies the soldiers' efforts to withstand the harsh conditions of the Nether Front.",
"scguns.desc.ghast_swatter": "The manual describes it as a ‘highly reliable lightweight rocket launcher’. Well, that was 20 years ago. ",
"scguns.desc.grunt_rifle": "Despite its numerous flaws, it's a firearm that excels at one thing: allowing even the most clumsy and unskilled to hit their target.",
"scguns.desc.haymaker": "This model was produced by requisitioning shotguns previously sold to civilians.",
"scguns.desc.hog_tenderizer": "Water-cooled machine gun saw action in previous wars. In the water-scarce Nether, its use of the most common ‘liquid’ there earned it its nickname.",
"scguns.desc.jungle_fighter": "The biggest problem in the early Nether Front was the stopping power of bullets. It didn't take long to find a solution.",
"scguns.desc.lamp_smg": "Lightweight Multi-purpose Personal Assault SMG. Among the tasks handled by Lamp Company, naming is certainly one of the important works.",
"scguns.desc.m11_pelagic": "Lightweight and easy-to-handle carbine rifle. It was primarily issued to artillery units, rear echelon troops, and tank drivers.",
"scguns.desc.m3_rifle": "It remained in the running until the very end of the combat rifle selection process, but the fact that it was not domestically produced was the most decisive factor.",
"scguns.desc.m8_benth": "Clip-fed rifle chambered for powerful rifle ammunition. Recently, the ‘finger myth’ has been one of the most heated topics of debate among scholars.",
"scguns.desc.m922_barrage": "Export model of the recoilless rifle used as a Heavy anti-tank weapon in the Republic.",
"scguns.desc.m928_stormsurge": "Conversion of an existing water-cooled machine gun to an air-cooled design. While its rate of fire is slow, it possesses outstanding sustained fire capability.",

"scguns.desc.pest_control_shotgun": "Extremely useful for cleaning up flying and crawling pests.",
"scguns.desc.pipegun": "Simple and crude bullet sprayer. Thanks to its characteristic of being easy to manufacture, it still appears in all kinds of wars.",
"scguns.desc.pirate_thumper": "Despite its name, this grenade launcher was most effectively used by those who fought against pirates.",
"scguns.desc.republic_standard": "Standard-issue assault rifle still in use in the Republic. Through continuous improvements, a device has been installed to prevent soldiers from wasting ammunition. This is what you call desk-bound bureaucracy.",
"scguns.desc.sand_buster": "Thanks to its durability, which is more than sufficient to withstand sand dust and sea salt, it is one of the shotguns beloved by Marines across many regions.",
"scguns.desc.sand_defender": "Easily found everywhere, from harsh deserts to concrete jungles.",
"scguns.desc.self_loading_rifle": "To suppress the high recoil that occurs during automatic fire, it has been modified to allow only semi-automatic firing. In some regions, it is often illegally modified to enable automatic fire.",
"scguns.desc.strumm88": "Incredibly innovative automatic rifle, hard to believe it was produced so urgently during wartime.",
"scguns.desc.tide_walker": "The developer of this rifle remained silent on why it cannot replace machine guns.",
"scguns.desc.top_break": "Seem more suited for collectors than military use, but finding such collectors in the Nether would be a difficult proposition.",
"scguns.desc.top_loader": "This is a squad support weapon with an upper magazine. It boasts high accuracy and is not difficult to handle, but its biggest drawbacks are the sight placement and the magazine capacity.",
"scguns.desc.trenchbroom": "If you encountered someone wielding this shotgun in trench warfare, you might feel like you've been reduced to dust.",
"scguns.desc.trilemma": "Developed for the role of a squad support weapon and carbine. In other words, it's neither one thing nor the other.",
"scguns.desc.variable_control_shotgun": "This is a semi-automatic shotgun that was stocked at research Lab and parks to prepare for attacks by harmful creatures.",
"scguns.desc.warthog": "One of the machine guns the Asgharians liked the most. The problem was that the Republic didn't want to sell it.",
"scguns.desc.whalefall": "Anti-tank weapon with powerful armor-piercing capabilities. Except for the fact that it's expensive...",
"scguns.desc.woodpecker": "With its rapid rate of fire and portability as its greatest strengths, this submachine gun is one of the Republic's best sellers.",
