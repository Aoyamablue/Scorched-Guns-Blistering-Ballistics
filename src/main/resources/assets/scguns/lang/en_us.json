  "item.scguns_bb.lesser_strawman.tooltip": "A doll used in rituals. You feel it move when you're not looking.",

"scguns.desc.ambassador": "This submachine gun was designed for VIP protection and urban combat. Its compact size and precision firing are its strengths, but the Asgharians adopted a different submachine gun.",
"scguns.desc.big_betsy": "How about loading multiple rounds? On the front lines, they're heavy, reloading is cumbersome, and they jam easily—but commanders say it doesn't matter.",
"scguns.desc.big_pipe": "This is a ‘replica’ of equipment that was used to great acclaim in the previous war. The fact that they're resorting to using something like this in this situation speaks to the grim reality.",
"scguns.desc.cave_cleaner": "It's used to fire a single shot to suppress enemies before entering a cave, but it was actually developed to counter COG equipment.",
"scguns.desc.coral_hunter": "Improved version based on a hunting rifle, sufficiently robust to withstand the harsh marine environment.",
"scguns.desc.door_knocker": "This is a grenade launcher that looks like it was made a century ago. It embodies the soldiers' efforts to withstand the harsh conditions of the Nether Front.",
"scguns.desc.ghast_swatter": "The manual describes it as a ‘highly reliable lightweight rocket launcher’. Well, that was 20 years ago. ",
"scguns.desc.grunt_rifle": "Despite its numerous flaws, it's a firearm that excels at one thing: allowing even the most clumsy and unskilled to hit their target.",
"scguns.desc.haymaker": "This model was produced by requisitioning shotguns previously sold to civilians.",
"scguns.desc.hog_tenderizer": "This water-cooled machine gun saw action in previous wars. In the water-scarce Nether, its use of the most common ‘liquid’ there earned it its nickname.",
"scguns.desc.jungle_fighter": "The biggest problem in the early Nether Front was the stopping power of bullets. It didn't take long to find a solution.",
"scguns.desc.lamp_smg": "Lightweight Multi-purpose Personal Assault SMG. Among the tasks handled by Lamp Company, naming is certainly one of the important works.",
"scguns.desc.m11_pelagic": "This is a lightweight and easy-to-handle carbine rifle. It was primarily issued to artillery units, rear echelon troops, and tank drivers.",
"scguns.desc.m3_rifle": "It remained in the running until the very end of the combat rifle selection process, but the fact that it was not domestically produced was the most decisive factor.",
"scguns.desc.m8_benth": "This is a clip-fed rifle chambered for powerful rifle ammunition. Recently, the ‘finger myth’ has been one of the most heated topics of debate among scholars.",
"scguns.desc.m922_barrage": "This is the export model of the recoilless rifle used as a Heavy anti-tank weapon in the Republic.",
"scguns.desc.m928_stormsurge": "This machine gun is a conversion of an existing water-cooled machine gun to an air-cooled design. While its rate of fire is slow, it possesses outstanding sustained fire capability.",
"scguns.desc.mad_minute": "During the Second Nether front, the Hoglins believed the number of humans who had invaded their territory to be greater than their own. They soon realized that was not the case.",
"scguns.desc.metal_jacket_rifle": "Nether expedition team, reluctant to waste the ammunition they had already produced, went out of their way to retrieve these cumbersome rifles from storage for use. They soon realized they had made a mistake.",
"scguns.desc.neptun_spear": "This PDW boasts a short, lightweight, and futuristic design. It has earned the affection of those participating in various covert ops.",
"scguns.desc.nether_fighter": "It is renowned as a classic and reliable pistol. This has been proven even in the Nether.",
"scguns.desc.pest_control_shotgun": "This shotgun is extremely useful for cleaning up flying and crawling pests.",
"scguns.desc.pipegun": "It's a simple and crude bullet sprayer. Thanks to its characteristic of being easy to manufacture, it still appears in all kinds of wars.",
"scguns.desc.pirate_thumper": "Despite its name, this grenade launcher was most effectively used by those who fought against pirates.",
"scguns.desc.republic_standard": "This is the standard-issue assault rifle still in use in the Republic. Through continuous improvements, a device has been installed to prevent soldiers from wasting ammunition. This is what you call desk-bound bureaucracy.",
"scguns.desc.sand_buster": "Thanks to its durability, which is more than sufficient to withstand sand dust and sea salt, it is one of the shotguns beloved by Marines across many regions.",
"scguns.desc.sand_defender": "This pistol is easily found everywhere, from harsh deserts to concrete jungles.",
"scguns.desc.self_loading_rifle": "To suppress the high recoil that occurs during automatic fire, it has been modified to allow only semi-automatic firing. In some regions, it is often illegally modified to enable automatic fire.",
"scguns.desc.strumm88": "It's an incredibly innovative automatic rifle, hard to believe it was produced so urgently during wartime.",
"scguns.desc.tide_walker": "The developer of this rifle remained silent on why it cannot replace machine guns.",
"scguns.desc.top_break": "It might seem more suited for collectors than military use, but finding such collectors in the Nether would be a difficult proposition.",
"scguns.desc.top_loader": "This is a squad support weapon with an upper magazine. It boasts high accuracy and is not difficult to handle, but its biggest drawbacks are the sight placement and the magazine capacity.",
"scguns.desc.trenchbroom": "If you encountered someone wielding this shotgun in trench warfare, you might feel like you've been reduced to dust.",
"scguns.desc.trilemma": "This weapon was developed for the role of a squad support weapon and carbine. In other words, it's neither one thing nor the other.",
"scguns.desc.variable_control_shotgun": "This is a semi-automatic shotgun that was stocked at research Lab and parks to prepare for attacks by harmful creatures.",
"scguns.desc.warthog": "One of the machine guns the Asgharians liked the most. The problem was that the Republic didn't want to sell it.",
"scguns.desc.whalefall": "It's an anti-tank weapon with powerful armor-piercing capabilities. Except for the fact that it's expensive...",
"scguns.desc.woodpecker": "With its rapid rate of fire and portability as its greatest strengths, this submachine gun is one of the Republic's best sellers.",

  "scguns_bb.jei.info.gravekeeper_blueprint": "Can be obtained from Graveyard structures.",
  "tooltip.anathema": "Melee hits feed the \"gun\", restoring ammo.",
  "tooltip.bluntshot.knockback": "Deals increased knockback to hit targets.",
  "tooltip.hex_round.magic_damage": "Deals half of the bullet damage as magic damage."
